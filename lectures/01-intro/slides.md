# Today's agenda

- [ ] What DevOps actually means (not just "the tools")
- [ ] The toolchain map for this entire course
- [ ] How the Red Hat Academy partnership fits in
- [ ] The syllabus — grading & weekly plan
- [ ] How grading works (autograded, fast feedback, no surprise waits)
- [ ] What to do before next lecture

# "But it works on my machine."

If you've ever heard this — or said it — you already understand the
problem this entire course exists to solve.

# Block 1
## What is DevOps, really?

# The wall between Dev and Ops

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Developers<br/>'ship features fast'] -->|throws code over the wall| B[Operations<br/>'keep it stable']
  B -->|blames Dev when it breaks| A
```

<div class="mt-6">

Two teams, opposite incentives, one production system stuck in the middle.
DevOps exists because this wall was a organizational failure, not a
technical one.

</div>

# DevOps is a culture, not a tool — CALMS

<v-clicks>

- **C**ulture — shared ownership, no blame-throwing over the wall
- **A**utomation — humans shouldn't repeat what a script can do reliably
- **L**ean — small batches, fast feedback, cut waste
- **M**easurement — you can't improve what you don't measure
- **S**haring — knowledge and tooling belong to the whole team, not one hero

</v-clicks>

<div v-click class="mt-6 text-sm opacity-70">
Every tool in this course (Podman, Ansible, GitHub Actions) is an
implementation detail of one or more of these letters — not the point
itself.

<div class="mt-6 text-sm opacity-70">
Each box is one module of this course. Nothing here is optional trivia —
each module's lab builds directly on the last one.

# Why these specific tools

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6 mt-4 text-center">
<div v-click><logos-docker-icon class="text-5xl mx-auto" /><div class="mt-2 text-sm">Podman — CLI-compatible with Docker</div></div>
<div v-click><logos-ansible class="text-5xl mx-auto" /><div class="mt-2 text-sm">Ansible — already fully open-source</div></div>
<div v-click><logos-github-icon class="text-5xl mx-auto" /><div class="mt-2 text-sm">GitHub Actions — free tier, industry-standard</div></div>
</div>

<div v-click class="mt-8 p-4 rounded bg-blue-500/10 text-sm">
Rule of thumb for this whole course: whenever a lab uses a Red Hat–specific
tool, the README also tells you the free/open equivalent. Nothing here is
locked to one vendor.
</div>

# Where Red Hat Academy fits in

<v-clicks>

- SDU partners with Red Hat Academy (RHA) — this gives you **free** access
  to official Red Hat cloud labs for two modules: Containers (Podman) and
  Automation (Ansible).
- **Your grade for those two labs comes from finishing the RHA lab itself**
  — your instructor assigns it from the RHA portal, not from a GitHub check.
- These are the same labs used in paid corporate Red Hat training —
  normally not free.
- A few students each year get a shot at a real Red Hat certification
  voucher through this partnership.
- CI/CD isn't covered by RHA at all — that module runs entirely on GitHub,
  which you'd need anyway for literally any software job.

# The syllabus, in one slide

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 text-sm mt-2">
<div>

**Course:** INF 345 — Fundamentals of DevOps
**Credits:** 3 cr / 5 ECTS (2 lecture + 1 seminar + 2 lab hrs/week)
**Mode:** Online · **Type:** Elective
**Format:** 15 lessons, lecture + 1h practice each

</div>
<div>

**Final Exam:** delivered as a Capstone Project + demo
(policy allows a project to substitute for a written exam)
**Full doc:** <code>SYLLABUS.md</code> in the repo root
**Questions:** office hours, or email (see syllabus for etiquette)

</div>
</div>

<div v-click class="mt-6 p-3 rounded bg-blue-500/10 text-sm">
Read the full syllabus before Lesson 2 — it has the complete weekly plan,
assessment rubric pointers, and academic integrity policy.

# Every lecture has the same shape

<v-clicks>

1. **Recap** — 2-3 quick questions from last time (spaced repetition)
2. **Agenda** — today's roadmap as a checklist, always visible
3. **Hook** — why today's topic actually matters, before any theory
4. **Chunked blocks** — with a real break in between, ending early if we're done
5. **"Before next lecture"** — a concrete, short prep checklist

</v-clicks>

<div v-click class="mt-8 text-sm opacity-70">
This isn't arbitrary — short chunks, fast feedback, and a predictable
structure just work better for everyone.
</div>

# Fast feedback, not a week of waiting

<v-clicks>

- Fork this repo, do the work, open a Pull Request.
- GitHub Actions runs the autograder → you get a pass/fail/partial
  score **within minutes**.
- No submitting into a void and waiting for grades next week.
- Labs 01 and 02 are the exception — those grades come from Red Hat
  Academy, not GitHub.
