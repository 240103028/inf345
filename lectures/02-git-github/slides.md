# The scenario

<div class="text-lg text-left mt-4 max-w-2xl mx-auto">

`report_final.docx`, `report_final_v2.docx`,
`report_final_v2_ACTUALLY_FINAL.docx`, `report_final_v2_ACTUALLY_FINAL_fix.docx`.

Two teammates edit the same file. One's changes silently overwrite the
other's. Nobody remembers which version is on the server.

</div>

<div v-click class="mt-8 text-xl font-bold">
Git exists to make this scenario impossible.

# Block 1
## Git fundamentals

---

# Git tracks snapshots, not files

<v-clicks>

- Every commit is a **snapshot** of your whole project at that moment —
  not just a list of changed lines.
- Each commit points to its **parent**, forming a history you can walk
  backwards through.
- Nothing is a commit until you explicitly say so — Git never saves
  automatically.

</v-clicks>

---

# The three states

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Working directory<br/>your actual files] -->|git add| B[Staging area<br/>what will go in the next commit]
  B -->|git commit| C[Repository<br/>permanent history]
```

<div v-click class="mt-6 text-sm opacity-70">
`git add` doesn't save anything permanently — it just marks what you
intend to commit next. This two-step process is why you can commit
exactly the changes you meant to, not everything you touched.
</div>

---

# A commit, edited live

```md {monaco-diff}
# inf345-lab

A student's Ansible playbook for Lab 02.
~~~
# inf345-lab

A student's Ansible playbook for Lab 02.

## Status
Idempotent — verified with a second run.
```

<div class="mt-4 text-sm opacity-70">
This is what `git diff` shows you before you commit: exactly what changed,
line by line. Edit either panel — the diff updates live.
</div>

---

# The core loop

```bash {1|2|3|4|all}
git status
git add README.md
git commit -m "Document idempotence check"
git log --oneline
```

<div v-click class="mt-6 text-sm opacity-70">
This four-command loop is 90% of what you'll do with Git day to day.
Everything else — branches, remotes, rebasing — builds on top of it.
</div>

---
layout: center
class: text-center

# Quick check

<div class="text-xl mt-4">
Why does Git separate "staging" from "committing" instead of just
committing everything you've changed?
</div>

<div v-click class="mt-8 text-lg opacity-70">
So you can commit a coherent, reviewable unit of change — not an
accidental mix of unrelated edits.
</div>

# Block 2
## Branching & the GitHub workflow

---

# Local vs remote

```mermaid
graph TB
  subgraph "Your laptop"
    A[Working directory] --> B[Local repo]
  end
  subgraph "GitHub"
    C[Remote repo]
  end
  B -->|git push| C
  C -->|git pull / git clone| B
```

<div class="mt-6 text-sm opacity-70">
Git itself is fully local and works with no internet connection. GitHub is
just a hosted remote — a shared place everyone pushes to and pulls from.
</div>

---

# Branches are just pointers

<v-clicks>

- A branch is a lightweight, movable pointer to a commit — not a copy of
  the whole project.
- `main` is just a convention for "the default branch," not a special
  technical concept.
- Creating a branch is instant because it doesn't duplicate any files.

</v-clicks>

<div v-click class="mt-6 p-4 rounded bg-blue-500/10 text-sm">
For this course: you generally won't need extra branches — you'll work on
<code>main</code> in your fork and open a PR. Branches matter more once
you're collaborating with others, which is why the capstone uses them.
</div>

---

# How you'll actually submit work in this course

```bash {1|2-3|4-6|7-8|all}
# 1. Fork the course repo on GitHub (button, top right) — this gives you your own copy
gh repo fork weeebdev/inf345 --clone
cd inf345
# ... do the work in your lab/practice folder ...
git add .
git commit -m "Complete practice exercise"
git push
gh pr create --repo weeebdev/inf345
```

<div v-click class="mt-6 text-sm opacity-70">
Opening that PR is what triggers the autograder — GitHub Actions checks
your PR automatically and posts a score. Your PR isn't meant to be
merged; it's just how the check runs. Every GitHub-native lab and
practice session in this course follows this loop.
</div>

<div v-click class="mt-4 p-3 rounded bg-blue-500/10 text-sm">
Heads up: forks of a public repo are public too — anyone can see your PR.
Don't put anything in a submission you wouldn't want classmates to see.
</div>

---

# Keep your fork in sync

<v-clicks>

- You fork <code>weeebdev/inf345</code> **once**.
- Before every later practice or GitHub lab, **sync your fork** so you
  have this week's files.
- On your fork's GitHub page: <b>Sync fork</b> → Update branch.
- Skip this and you'll be working on last week's repo.

# Today's practice session — 1 hour

<v-clicks>

- [ ] Fork <code>weeebdev/inf345</code> (or <b>Sync fork</b> if you already have one)
- [ ] Make 3 separate commits in <code>practices/02-git-github/</code>
- [ ] Open a PR back to <code>weeebdev/inf345</code> — that triggers the autograder
- [ ] PR open before the session ends — this is also your attendance signal

</v-clicks>

<div v-click class="mt-6 text-sm opacity-70">
See <code>practices/02-git-github/README.md</code> for the exact task and
definition of done.
